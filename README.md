Every lesson repository in Github, whether a lab or a lesson, has three common files: **Contributing, License, and .learn** files. 

Students going through our curriculum can raise issues if they see any problems with a lesson, and the contributing file contains guidelines on how to do so.  

The license file contains our copyright information, which is very similar to a Creative Commons license. All of our curriculum is open sourced on Github.

These two files above are the same no matter what the lesson content is. 

The .learn file is where you include tags to describe whatâ€™s covered in the lesson and this will of course vary depending on the content. 

In order to avoid manually creating these files every time you make a new lesson, we created a gem you install and run. 

Run **"gem install learn_writer"**
Type  **"learn-write"** from the  command line in any directory where you want to create those files 

The files will be created and the only thing that you'll have to update is the .learn file in Github.

## The .learn file

 A typical `.learn` file looks something like this:
 
 ```
 tags:
   - arrays
   - CRUD
   - basic arrays
 languages:
   - Ruby
 resources:
   - 0
 type:
   - lab
 ```
 
 It's important to note the `:` after the grouping name. It's equally important to not the space between the `-` and the tag or language name. Without this space, the piece of  curriculum can't be added to track on Learn.co.
 
 ### Tags
 
The tags are a list of all the topics the lab or lesson addresses. If you're working a basic Ruby lab that deals with arrays, iteration, indexes, you would want to include those as your tags.

Use Case        | Example Tags
----------------|------------------------------
topics/concepts | algorithms, arrays, authorization, methods, computer science, join tables, iteration
frameworks      | rails, sinatra, angular
libraries       | jquery, popcorn.js
orms            | arel, activerecord, sequel, sql

#### Examples of good tagging:

tags: rails, strong params, complex nested forms, fields_for

tags: methods, variable assignment, iteration

tags: jquery, variable scope
 
 ### Languages
 
 The languages section is all the langauges the student will practice in the lesson or lab. A frontend lab might have several languages:
 
 ```
 languages:
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - jQuery
   - JavaScript
 ```
 
 ### Resources
 
 Resources holds an integer, the number of resources listed in the lesson or lab. It's ok if your lesson or lab doesn't have any resources.
 
 
 ### Type
 
 The type section lets us mark the category of curriculum. Is it a lab or a readme? 
 

## What Happens If I Don't Add in These Files?

We've created a linter that checks to make sure that all the above files have been added and have been added correctly. If you're missing any of these files or if, for example, there are problems with how you updated your .learn file, the linter will alert you to these failures when you make a Pull Request).
